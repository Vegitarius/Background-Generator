# background-generator

This was one of the first projects that I uploaded.

It is a fairly simple website, built completely by me.

It displays the current inear gradient background that the user can copy and paste into their css. You are able to switch the colors that make up the background and has the ability to randomize. I later used it on my face-detection project.
